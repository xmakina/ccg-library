## Players

2 -4. One each of Alien, Predator, Marine and/or Rogue.

## Play Deck

Each player may have as many non-Unique items as they wish. With the below exceptions, each may have up to 3 of each others non-Unique cards (Supporting Characters, Locations, Events, and Aliens) and only one of any Unique card in their play deck. Starting cards do not count towards this limit. Deck must contain at least 40 cards.

Additionally, There must be at least 4 total Supporting Characters and at least 3 different Supporting Characters in the deck. There must be at least 6 total and at least 4 different Locations in the deck. One of these locations must be Operations. These limitations do NOT include starting locations. The UA 571C Sentry Gun is limited to three per deck. Hand Welder and Hull Breach are both considered unique for purposes of deck-building.

| Faction | Starting Combat Pools (optional) | Base Hand Size |
|-|-|-|
| Aliens | 3 | 3 |
| Predator | 2 | 5 |
| Marines | 2 | 4 |
| Rogue | 2 | 4 |

*Aliens get +1 handsize for every Alien Warrior at the same location as the Queen at the start of the Discard and Draw round.*

*Rogues get +1 handsize for every Hostage(s) currently under control during the Discard and Draw round.*

## Special Rules

All players must have the Operations location in their deck.

Each player must play out any new locations drawn at the next Movement round (or discard if unplayable).

Marines must have a Docking Bay in their deck.

Rogues may only have 1 copy of EEV in their draw deck

## Victory Conditions

### Aliens

Kill all non-Alien Main Characters or convert all locations in play into Hived locations.

### Predator

Kill all non-Predator Main Characters, or score the honor requirements of chosen Predator and any items played; move to the Predator's Shuttle, then rotate Predator to evacuate from the battleground. (If there are any opponents in the shuttle, or player cannot evacuate Predator, player does not win.)

### Marines

Rescue a number of supporting characters dependent upon the main characters started with and evacuate one surviving Main Character, or kill all Alien and Predator Main Characters. To rescue a Supporting Character or evacuate a Marine, move him to the Docking Bay and rotate him at the beginning of the Movement round. Rotating him removes him from the game. A Basic starting squad consisting of a Corporal and 3 Privates must rescue 5 Supporting Characters. This requirement increases by one every time the squad is altered in one of the following ways:

1. For each Pvt. or Cpl. replaced by a higher-ranking Character (Cpl., Sgt., Lt., WO), add 1 Supporting Character.
1. For any Non-Ranked Character (e.g., Ripley, Kane, Bishop) add 1 Supporting Character.

For example, a Squad of Cpl. Hicks, Sgt. Bass, Kane, and WO Kraver would need to rescue 8 Supporting Characters: Bass adds 1 (Sgt.), Kane adds 1 (Non-Ranked), and Kraver adds 1 (Higher rank than Private).

### Rogues

Bring seven non-Rogue Supporting Characters back to the Rogue's starting Airlock location and evacuate. Or Characters must retrieve a total of 12 Data tokens. A character with a Data Drive or a Synthectic that begins in the Rogue's starting entry location at the beginning of the Movement round, can rotate to download all Data tokens on that character/item at that location. This action can still be accomplished if there are opponents at this location. Or kill all opponents.

## Deck Construction Rules

* It may not contain any copies of the location where the opposing player starts his game.
* It must have a minimum of forty cards.
* It may only contain one copy of any card which is "Unique."
* It may not contain more than three copies of any "non-Unique" card, except for items.
* The Marine player may only play one of each named Marine Main Characters (Ash, Bishop, Ripley); only the Marine Private character may be played in multiples.
