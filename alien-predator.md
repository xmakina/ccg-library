## Scenario Play

Aliens Predator is an unusual CCG because play is done through scenarios rather than standard match play. This means that restrictions around deck size, duplication limits, starting cards, even player counts, are determined by the scenario chosen by the players.

The default [Contact Scenario](./alien-predator/contact.md) has the following:

* Deck Size: Minimum 40; must include 4 supporting characters and at least 3 different supporting characters. There must be at least 6 total and at least 4 different Locations in the deck. One of these locations must be Operations.
* Duplicate Card Limit: 3, unless Unique; Hand Welder and Hull Breach are both considered unique.
* Players: 2 - 4
* Factions/Teams: 4
